Following this helps:

people in a hurry – if you read something quickly you can get it wrong if it's not clear
people who are stressed – if you're anxious it's hard to comprehend things
people who are multi-tasking – if you're distracted it's easier to misread something
cognitive impairments – spelled out words take less mental effort to understand
