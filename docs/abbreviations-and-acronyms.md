Following this helps:

people in a hurry – words make immediate sense, acronyms may require guesswork
people who are stressed – not knowing what something means may make you feel worse
people who are multi-tasking – with divided attention anything unclear will puzzle you
cognitive impairments – meaningful words require less mental effort
visual impairments – a smaller visual field means having the full version in context is useful
