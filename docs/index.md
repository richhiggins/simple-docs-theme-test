## The project

In 2018 Sarah Richards asked if, working together, we can create a universal, inclusive style guide. Because "style guide" can mean different things, we called it the Readability Guidelines project.

Content professionals in multiple sectors held regular global discussions for a total of 24 weeks. This was Alpha and Beta. And it's all continuing: you can get involved.
